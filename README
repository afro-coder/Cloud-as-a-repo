# Dumping whatever I learn in AWS/GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean
one file/$0.05/hr

I gave an AWS interview and honestly it was way beyond my level
So as usual my interest based learning has kicked in.

## Goals:
I want to do these programatically using Terraform/Cloudformation/CDK(These are the words I've heard so far)

AWS/GCP/Azure
* How to setup a VPC/Firewall
* How to setup a Load Balancer
* Setup a web application in managed services
* Setup a Rails/Python/Golang  application cause why not!
* Build a CI/CD Pipeline 

Hopefully I can do atleast one of this.
